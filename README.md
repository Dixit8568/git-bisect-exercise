## Git bisect exercise

- Clone or fork it from [here](https://github.com/bast/git-bisect-exercise)

The script `get_pi.py` calculates pi using the 100 first terms of the
Nilakantha series. It should produce 3.141592 but it does not. The script broke
and produces 3.264592 using the last commit:
```
$ python get_pi.py

3.2645924109719804
```

At each commit, the 100 terms were reshuffled. At some point within the 500
first commits, an error was introduced. The only thing we know is that the
first commit worked correctly.


### Your task

Use `git bisect` to find the commit which broke the computation.


### Bonus exercise

Write a script that checks for a correct result and use `git bisect run` to
find the offending commit automatically.


### Motivation

The motivation for this exercise is to be able to do archaeology with Git on a
source code where the bug is difficult to see visually. Finding the offending
commit is often more than half the debugging. In this particular example the
knowledge about the offending commit will not help us but in reality mastering
git bisect is often a huge time saver.
